# 2-ls-into-list

1. Go into the folder of renamed Imgur exported files in terminal

2. Then run `ls > ../results.txt`

3. The results.txt will have all the filenames you need to git diff against the Obsidian MD's imgur filenames, to figure out what wasn't exported from Imgur (before your account closed). You have a short time before Imgur remove your files forever (even though your account is removed, the files are still in their server cache).
